=============
ckanext-qadashboard
=============

``ckanext-qadashboard`` enables a QA based user dashboard and a problem notification system for datasets. 

Plugins
------------
This extension contains two plugins, **qadashboard** and **notifyproblems**. 

Both make use of the model implemented with SQLAlchemy that can be found in the ``model.py`` file and the ``commands.py`` commands controller that creates the tables for the model.
The ``utils.py`` file contains methods that are common to both plugins, such as obtaining the list of datasets that the current user can edit.

------------
qadashboard
------------

Enables a QA user dashboard showing basic information about user's datasets (qa levels, lowest rated datasets, last added problems, last week views and dataset/site average values).

The plugin main class is ``plugin.py`` and its controller class is ``qa_controller.py``. Its template files can be found under ``templates/qadashboard``.

Chart.js 2.7.3 is included through a CDN in order to show the openness score and last week views charts.

------------
notifyproblems
------------

Enables the problem notification subsystem and adds a "Problems" menu option for each dataset and to the user dashboard.

The plugin main class is ``plugin_notify.py`` and its controller class is ``problem_controller.py``. Its template files can be found under ``templates/notifyproblems``.

All users can view problems reported on a dataset from the "Problems" tab at the dataset detail page. From this tab, logged in users can also add a new problem for the dataset by clicking "Add problem".

The problem detail page shows all information about the problem added and user updates. Logged in users can add updates by clicking the "Update problem" button, but only users with permissions to edit the dataset can change problem's status.
