        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install ckanext-qadashboard:
        
        1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example:
        
             . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate
        
        2. Clone the project in your main ckan folder, usually ``/etc/ckan/default/src/``:
        
             git clone https://github.com/ammendoza/ckanext-qadashboard.git
        	 
        3. Initialize the required database tables by running the following command:
        
             paster --plugin=ckanext-qadashboard qadashboard initdb --config=/etc/ckan/default/production.ini
        
        4. Add ``qadashboard`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
           config file (by default the config file is located at
           ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).
        
        5. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu:
        
             sudo service apache2 reload
